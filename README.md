# iToilet

Inspired by Seinfeld iToilet is an app that allows you to find the best public restrooms at a moment's notice so when nature calls, you'll be ready.

iToilet also allows for users to add new public toilets as well as their own private toilets if they would like to make a bit of side cash off some desperate strangers.
